    "<u>Answer</u> :\n",
    "\n",
    "- The vault file is encrypted at rest using a key derived from a master password.\n",
    "- API keys are not echoed when typed (masked input via getpass).\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. What is the master password used for?**\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Answer</u> :\n",
    "- It never gets saved. It’s combined with a salt and processed by PBKDF2 to derive the symmetric encryption key used by Fernet.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. What is a salt and why is it stored in the file?**\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Answer</u> :\n",
    "- A salt is random bytes saved next to the ciphertext.\n",
    "- It ensures the derived key is unique per vault, even if two people use the same password, defeating rainbow-table attacks.\n",
    "- It’s not secret and must be stored so we can derive the same key later.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. What are PBKDF2 iterations and what tradeoff do they make?**\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Answer</u> :\n",
    "- Iterations repeat the hashing step many times to make key derivation computationally expensive.\n",
    "- Tradeoff: a tiny delay for legitimate users; a big slowdown for attackers trying many passwords.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. What does “encode raw 32 bytes as urlsafe base64” mean?**\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Answer</u> :\n",
    "- PBKDF2 outputs 32 raw bytes. Fernet expects the key as base64 text (urlsafe variant uses - and _ instead of + and /).\n",
    "- This makes the key printable/storable while representing the same bytes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. What is the Fernet key and why use Fernet?**\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Answer</u> :\n",
    "- It’s the symmetric key (32 bytes, base64) used by the Fernet scheme.\n",
    "- Fernet provides confidentiality and integrity (detects tampering) with a simple API—safe and beginner-friendly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**7. Why does the file show only one big ciphertext string even after multiple entries?**\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Answer</u> :\n",
    "- The entire secrets dict is encrypted as one blob. Each save re-encrypts the whole dict, so you see a single ciphertext field that changes over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**8. Where does plaintext exist in Step 2?**\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Answer</u> :\n",
    "- Only in memory while the program runs.\n",
    "- On disk, secrets are always encrypted (no plaintext in the file).\n",
    "\n",
    "**9. What happens if I type the wrong master password?**\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Answer</u> :\n",
    "- Decryption fails with InvalidToken (wrong password or tampered file). The program shows a friendly error and doesn’t reveal anything.\n",
    "\n",
    "**10. What if the vault file is corrupted or malformed?**\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Answer</u> :\n",
    "- The loader raises a clear error (e.g., malformed header, bad base64).\n",
    "- Easiest fix: back up or remove the bad file and let the program create a new empty vault (you’ll need to re-add secrets).\n",
    "\n",
    "**11. How is the API key input masked?**\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Answer</u> :\n",
    "- Using getpass.getpass(...), which doesn’t echo what you type (in Terminal it shows nothing; in some UIs it may show dots).\n",
    "\n",
    "**12. Can I list what services are stored without revealing keys?**\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Answer</u> :\n",
    "- Yes—add a “List services” option that prints vault.keys() only. Keys remain encrypted on disk and unseen on screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "**13. How do I change the master password?**\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Answer</u> :\n",
    "- Simplest approach (manual): open the vault with the old password, export the in-memory dict, then re-encrypt it to a new vault using the new password. (You can add a helper function later.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**14. Is the salt secret? Should I hide it?**\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Answer</u> :\n",
    "- No. The salt is public by design and safe to store alongside the ciphertext. The password remains your true secret.\n",
    "\n",
    "**15. Why still use UTF-8 and JSON inside encryption?**\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Answer</u> :\n",
    "- We JSON-serialize the dict to bytes (UTF-8) before encrypting. This keeps the in-memory data structure simple and portable while the file contents stay encrypted."
