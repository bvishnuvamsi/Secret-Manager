# Secret-Manager

A step-by-step, beginner-friendly build of a small Secrets Manager that stores and retrieves API keys, first in memory, then in a plaintext file, then encrypted at rest, and finally with a SQLite backend. Each step has its own Jupyter notebook.

üì¶ Files in this repo

- step_1a_store_and_retrieve_in_memory.ipynb ‚Äî in-memory prototype (plaintext, no persistence)
- step_1b_store_and_retrieve_in_file.ipynb ‚Äî plaintext file persistence with JSON
- step_2_add_Encryption.ipynb ‚Äî encrypted file vault (PBKDF2 + Fernet) + masked input
- step_3_database_connection.ipynb ‚Äî SQLite + encryption (per-row encrypted secrets)

### Notebooks are the primary format. If you prefer running from Terminal, you can convert notebooks to .py:

> jupyter nbconvert --to script step_2_add_Encryption.ipynb

> python3 step_2_add_Encryption.py

### Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter (for .ipynb)

### Packages:
> pip install cryptography
- (SQLite ships with Python; no separate install needed on macOS/Linux/Windows.)

### Quick Start (Jupyter)
#### From the project folder:

- jupyter notebook
- Open each notebook in order and run all cells. Each step prints a simple menu:
- Store API key (service ‚Üí key)
- Retrieve API key by service name
- (From Step 1B onward) persists between runs
- (From Step 2 onward) encrypted at rest
- (From Step 2) API key input is masked
- (From Step 3) optional: list services, delete, change master password (added)
- (From Step 3) Added the database storing + Encryption

### Step-by-step Guide

1) Step 1A ‚Äî In-Memory (plaintext)

File: step_1a_store_and_retrieve_in_memory.ipynb

- What it shows:
  - Basic menu loop (while True)
  - Python dict as a key‚Üívalue store: service ‚Üí api_key
  - Data is lost on exit (no files written)

- Expected behavior:
  - Store and retrieve within the same run
  - After restart, data is gone (on purpose)

2) Step 1B ‚Äî Plaintext File (JSON)

File: step_1b_store_and_retrieve_in_file.ipynb

- What it adds:
  - Persists secrets to vault_plain.json (UTF-8, JSON)
  - Handles missing/invalid file gracefully (starts fresh)

- Security note:
  - Insecure by design for learning: keys are in plaintext on disk

3) Step 2 ‚Äî Encrypted File Vault

File: step_2_add_Encryption.ipynb

- What it adds (secure):
    - Prompts for a master password (hidden input via getpass)
    - Derives a key with PBKDF2-HMAC(SHA256) using random salt and iterations
    - Encrypts the entire dict with Fernet (authenticated encryption)
    - Stores vault.enc.json containing:
        {
          "version": 1,
          "kdf": "PBKDF2HMAC-SHA256",
          "iterations": 200000,
          "salt": "<base64>",
          "ciphertext": "<base64>"
        }
  - No plaintext on disk; only decrypted in memory while running
  - API keys input is masked (not echoed)

- Typical menu:
  - Store (encrypted)
  - Retrieve
  - List services (names only)
  - Quit

4) Step 3 ‚Äî SQLite + Encryption

File: step_3_database_connection.ipynb
- What it adds:
  - Database file: vault.sqlite
  - Tables:
      - meta(key, value) ‚Üí stores salt (base64) and iterations
      - secrets(service PRIMARY KEY, ciphertext BLOB) ‚Üí one encrypted row per service
      - Same crypto model (PBKDF2 + Fernet), but now:
  - Easier to list, delete, update individual services
  - Optional Change Master Password re-encrypts all rows with a new salt/key



#### Security Model (Step 2/3)

- Master password: never stored.
- Salt: random bytes, stored openly to allow reproducing the same derived key; defeats rainbow tables.
- Iterations: increases computation cost for attackers (brute-force resistance).
- Fernet: symmetric encryption with integrity (detects tampering).
- Plaintext exposure: only in RAM while the program runs.

#### How to Test

- Store a couple of services (e.g., github, openai).
- List services (names only).
- Retrieve and confirm the exact API keys.
- Restart the notebook/program and confirm persistence:
  - Step 1A: keys are gone (expected).
  - Step 1B/2/3: keys persist.
- Use a wrong master password (Step 3): retrieval should fail safely.

#### Troubleshooting

- Running .ipynb with python3 shows NameError: null:
- Notebooks are JSON; don‚Äôt run them with Python directly. Use Jupyter or convert to .py:

> jupyter nbconvert --to script step_2_add_Encryption.ipynb

> python3 step_2_add_Encryption.py

- ‚ÄúSalt must be bytes and at least 8 bytes long.‚Äù
- Your vault.enc.json is malformed (perhaps edited by hand). Rename it and let the script create a fresh one:

> mv vault.enc.json vault.enc.json.bak

üìù License / Disclaimer

- This project is for learning. Don‚Äôt commit real secrets to version control. Use strong passwords and keep backups of your vault files (encrypted).
